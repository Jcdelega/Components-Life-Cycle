# 🚀 Space Explorer Control Panel

This project simulates a **Space Explorer’s Control Panel**, allowing the user to experience and understand the **React component lifecycle** while practicing with key React Hooks.

## 🧠 About the Project

This web application is designed as a learning exercise to deepen your understanding of React. You take the role of a space explorer building a dashboard that displays critical journey data such as:

- Distance traveled  
- Fuel levels  
- Ship status  
- Visited planets  

The main goal is to **practice the use of React Hooks** like:

- `useState` for managing state  
- `useEffect` for triggering side effects (such as simulating flight progress)  
- `useMemo` to optimize heavy calculations  
- And gain a better grasp of the **component lifecycle** (mounting, updating, and unmounting)
